    <h1>diffrents between local storage and session storage</h1> <br>

    
1. Data Persistence:
   - Local Storage: Data stored in local storage persists even after the browser is closed and is available across browser sessions. It remains stored until explicitly removed by the user or cleared programmatically.
   - Session Storage: Data stored in session storage is only available within the same browsing session. It is cleared when the user closes the browser or tab.

<br>2. Scope: 
   - Local Storage: Data stored in local storage is accessible to all tabs and windows of the same origin (same protocol, host, and port).
   - Session Storage: Data stored in session storage is only accessible within the same tab or window that created it.

<br>3. Sharing Data:
   - Local Storage: Since data in local storage is accessible across all tabs and windows of the same origin, it can be used to share data between different parts of a web application that are open in different tabs or windows.
   - Session Storage: Data in session storage is limited to the current tab or window, so it can't be shared directly with other tabs or windows.

<br>4. Expiration:
   - Local Storage: Data in local storage does not have an expiration date, so it persists until explicitly removed.
   - Session Storage: Data in session storage is automatically cleared when the browsing session ends, i.e., when the browser or tab is closed.

    <h1>ifference between global scope and block scope</h1>

    Global Scope:
Variables declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in the code, including all functions, blocks, or nested scopes.
The lifetime of variables in the global scope extends throughout the entire runtime of the application.
Global variables can lead to potential naming conflicts and make it harder to maintain code as they are easily accessible and modifiable from any part of the application.
In JavaScript, variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. <br>


<br> Block Scope:
Variables declared in a block scope are only accessible within that specific block or statement. A block is usually defined by curly braces {} in most programming languages.
The lifetime of block-scoped variables is limited to the execution of the block in which they are declared. Once the block is exited, the variables are no longer accessible.
Block-scoped variables help in avoiding naming conflicts and are more secure since they are confined to the specific block where they are declared.

    <h1>Javascript undefine reasons</h1>

   <br> 1) Variable Declaration without Initialization:
    If you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, the variable will have an initial value of undefined.

   <br> 2) In JavaScript, there are several reasons why a variable or expression might evaluate to undefined. Here are five common situations that can result in undefined:
    
    Variable Declaration without Initialization:
    If you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, the variable will have an initial value of undefined.
    
   <br>3) Functions without a Return Statement:
   If a function does not have an explicit return statement or if it reaches the end of the function without returning anything, 
   the function will return undefined.
